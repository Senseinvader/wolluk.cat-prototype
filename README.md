## Instructions for examining the code

Hi!
Before start please run ``` npm install ```as ```packajes.json``` was updated.

The laset version of code for the first part of the assignment can be found on the admin branch ``` admin ```. Requirements of the **issue #2** fulfilled except **gravatar**. Also adding and deleting users doesn't work correctly as the code uses from hardcoded array of users which rewrites all changes.

Code for the **issue #2** can be found on the branch ``` firebase```. Here You can test functionality of a signed in user. Admin possibilities (editing application users data) were not implemented. Also search doesn't work.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
